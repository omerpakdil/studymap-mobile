# Expo Guidelines

## Expo Tools and Services
- Use Expo Tools: Utilize Expo's EAS Build and Updates for continuous deployment and Over-The-Air (OTA) updates
- Leverage Expo's managed workflow when possible for simplified development
- Use Expo CLI for project management and development tasks
- Take advantage of Expo's extensive library of APIs and components

## Expo Router
- Expo Router: Use Expo Router for file-based routing in your React Native app
- It provides native navigation, deep linking, and works across Android, iOS, and web
- Refer to the official documentation for setup and usage: https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/
- Organize route files in the `app` directory following the file-based routing convention
- Use layout files for shared UI across multiple routes

## Development Workflow
- Use Expo Go for quick testing during development
- Implement EAS Build for production builds
- Set up EAS Update for over-the-air updates
- Use Expo's environment variables for configuration management

## Platform Compatibility
- Ensure features work across Android, iOS, and web when using Expo Router
- Test thoroughly on all target platforms
- Use platform-specific code when necessary with Platform.select()
- Consider web compatibility when building universal apps

## Configuration
- Properly configure app.json/app.config.js for your project needs
- Set up proper deep linking configuration
- Configure splash screens and app icons through Expo tools
- Use Expo's prebuild process when ejecting to bare workflow
