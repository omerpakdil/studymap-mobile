# General Code Style and Structure

## Code Quality Principles
- Write Clean, Readable Code: Ensure your code is easy to read and understand. Use descriptive names for variables and functions.
- Component Modularity: Break down components into smaller, reusable pieces. Keep components focused on a single responsibility.
- Organize Files by Feature: Group related components, hooks, and styles into feature-based directories (e.g., user-profile, chat-screen).

## Component Guidelines
- Use Functional Components: Prefer functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) over class components.
- Focus on Single Responsibility: Each component should have one clear purpose.
- Keep components small and focused for better maintainability and testing.

## File Organization
- Group related files by feature rather than by file type
- Use clear directory structures that reflect app functionality
- Separate business logic from UI components when possible
