# Naming Conventions

## Variables and Functions
- Use camelCase for variables and functions (e.g., `isFetchingData`, `handleUserInput`)
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose
- Boolean variables should start with `is`, `has`, `can`, or `should` (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasPermission`)

## Components
- Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `UserProfile`, `ChatScreen`)
- Component files should match the component name
- Use descriptive names that indicate the component's purpose

## Directories
- Use lowercase and hyphenated names for directories (e.g., `user-profile`, `chat-screen`)
- Directory names should be descriptive and match their feature area
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're commonly understood

## Constants
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants (e.g., `API_BASE_URL`, `MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS`)
- Group related constants in dedicated files

## Files
- Use kebab-case for utility files and non-component files
- Use PascalCase for component files
- Use descriptive file names that indicate their content
